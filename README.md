------------------------프로젝트 관련 사항 --------------------------

이번 프로젝트 하며 배운 점
1. git folk. -> 내가 이렇게 수정했는데 이거 가져가서 확인해보시구 괜찮으면 합쳐주세요!

2. axios instance. 기존에 모듈화를 할 때는 baseUrl만 분리하여 다른 config 파일에 보관하여 사용했다.(물론 이 또한, 모듈화의 일종이긴 하다.)
하지만, axios 모듈은 자체적으로 instance를 지원한다. axios.create함수로 axiosInstance를 뽑아내면 정말 baseURL의 저장 또한 필요 없어진다.(의존성 감소)
물론, 그래도 baseUrl은 다른 파일 혹은 .env파일에 보관하는게 안전하다.

3. .env를 사용할 때는 꼭 REACT_APP을 앞에 붙여주자

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
